-- ðŸ§© Exercise 0:
-- Select the today's date
select current_date;

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 1:
-- Select all confirmed bookings ordered by date (columns: booking_id, customer_id, booking_date, amount, status)

select booking_id, customer_id, booking_date, amount, status 
from bookings
where status  = 'confirmed'
order by booking_date;

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 2:
-- Find the total revenue from confirmed bookings (one number)

select
	sum(amount) as total_revenue
from bookings
where status = 'confirmed';

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 3:
-- Show total booking amount grouped by status (in two different rows)

select
	status,
	sum(amount) as total_revenue

-- Now, do the same, but show in two different columns, one for each status.

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 4:
-- Show monthly revenue for confirmed bookings
-- Hint: group by month (use EXTRACT and DATE_TRUNC and TO_CHAR)

select
	SUM(amount) as total_revenue,
	EXTRACT(MONTH FROM booking_date) as date_month

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 5:
-- Count how many distinct customers made bookings

select
	COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers
from bookings;

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 6:
-- Find duplicated booking_id values
-- Show booking_id and how many times it appears

select 
	booking_id,
	count(*) as duplicated_booking_id
from bookings

-- Now, show only the duplicated booking_id, just one time
select 
	booking_id,
	count(*) as duplicated_booking_id

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 7:
-- For each month, show two columns:
--   - confirmed_revenue
--   - cancelled_amount
-- Use CASE WHEN to build these two columns

select
	sum(case when status = 'confirmed' then amount else 0 end) as confirmed_total,
	sum(case when status = 'cancelled' then amount else 0 end) as cancelled_total

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 8:
-- Join bookings with customers to show revenue per country
-- Only include confirmed bookings
-- Columns: country, total_bookings, total_revenue

	COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
	SUM(b.amount) as total_revenue
from bookings b

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 9:
-- Filter the previous result to keep only countries
-- where total confirmed revenue > 400

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 10:
-- Build a small monthly performance report showing:
--   - year_month
--   - total_bookings
--   - unique_customers
--   - confirmed_revenue
--   - cancelled_revenue
--   - avg_amount (rounded to 2 decimals)
-- Order by month ascending
