-- ðŸ§  LEVEL 3 SQL PRACTICE â€” WINDOW FUNCTIONS & SUBQUERIES
-- ===========================================================
-- Tables:
--   practice.bookings_dedup
--   practice.customers
-- ===========================================================


-- ðŸ§© Exercise 1:
-- For each booking, show:
--   booking_id, customer_id, booking_date, amount,
--   and total revenue per customer (use a window function).

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 2:
-- For each booking, show:
--   booking_id, customer_id, amount,
--   and the average booking amount for that customer.

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 3:
-- Add a running total of confirmed revenue ordered by booking_date.

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 4:
-- Rank all customers by total confirmed revenue (1 = highest).

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 5:
-- Within each country, rank customers by total confirmed revenue.

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 6:
-- For each booking, show its previous and next booking_date
-- (use LAG and LEAD by customer_id).

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 7:
-- Deduplicate bookings keeping only the latest record per booking_id
-- (use ROW_NUMBER).

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 8:
-- Build a subquery that finds each customer's total confirmed revenue,
-- then select only those above 400 EUR.

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 9:
-- Compute average monthly revenue and compare each month's revenue
-- to the overall average (above or below average?).

-- ðŸ§© Exercise 10:
-- Create a final customer leaderboard:
--   customer_id, country, total_bookings, total_revenue,
--   revenue_rank (across all customers).
